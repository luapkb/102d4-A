## * _The Code Embarcation of Paul Bennett_ *

This Page is a dedicated and historical depiction of my education and personal development in coding.  I hope to provide a logical, navigable, and accessible for my own reference and for a showcase of my progress.



For the success of the students at Code Fellows We are ask to focus on maintaining a **“growth mindset”**.  This is the ideology that a person's intelligence is not fixed but changeable by the experiences in the present and relative past.  Maintaining a positive attitude and seeking to overcome challenges rather than see difficulty as an obstacle is an important aspect of maintaining a growth mindset.  

It is important to remind yourself to keep a growth mindset.  It's really not that hard though. Some examples of keeping your focus could be;

1. _Everyone is required to learn new things, and it's not easy for anyone._ 

1. _Mistakes are inevitable, and good learning opportunities._

1. _Help is almost always available and is important in the learning process._


My name is Paul and I look forward to getting to know you.
