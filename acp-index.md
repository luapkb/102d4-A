            Lets learn about HTML

            <H2> what is it and <br> Hypertext Markup Language    </H2>
                <P>
                    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            <h2>How does it work</h2>
                    <p>HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author â€” these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages.</p>
